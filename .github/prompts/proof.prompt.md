# Instructions

Perform a light copy edit: fix spelling, punctuation, capitalization, and minor grammatical errors only.
Do not rewrite, rephrase, reorder, or change the tone or meaning.
For major grammatical or clarity issues, flag them and provide suggested revisions, but do not apply them.

Use plural verb forms with organization names when referring to actions, decisions, or work performed by people within the organization (e.g., "OpenAI are developing new models"). Use singular verb forms when referring to the organization as a legal entity, in contexts of ownership, corporate structure, or branding (e.g., "OpenAI is valued at billions").
When in doubt: If you can naturally substitute "the people at [Organization]" or "researchers at [Organization]," use plural. If the sentence is about the organization as an institution or corporate entity, use singular.
