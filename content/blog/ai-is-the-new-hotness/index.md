training llama 3 was equivalent to releasing 2290 tCO2eq

> To train our largest Llama 3 models, we combined three types of parallelization: data parallelization, model
> parallelization, and pipeline parallelization. Our most efficient implementation achieves a compute utilization of
> over 400 TFLOPS per GPU when trained on 16K GPUs simultaneously. We performed training runs on two custom-built 24K
> GPU clusters. To maximize GPU uptime, we developed an advanced new training stack that automates error detection,
> handling, and maintenance. We also greatly improved our hardware reliability and detection mechanisms for silent data
> corruption, and we developed new scalable storage systems that reduce overheads of checkpointing and rollback. Those
> improvements resulted in an overall effective training time of more than 95%. Combined, these improvements increased
> the efficiency of Llama 3 training by ~three times compared to Llama 2.

## add'l environmental impacts

- Reported tCO2eq is just co2 equivalent for electricity that's "100% of which were offset by Meta's sustainability
  program."

## Hard math

NVIDIA releasing 1M H100s over the past 6 months (inferring from Dylan Patel)? How much heat do 1M H100s put out?

world's largest carbon capture facility can capture 36,000 tons of CO2 per year[^co2] [^co2]:
