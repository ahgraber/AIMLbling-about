# Hello World!
<!-- markdownlint-enable -->

That's perhaps too flippant of a start...  Let me try again:

## In which I organize my thoughts

I often email myself about an incipient notion hoping that I'll be able to revisit it later from a harried five-word note,
or that it will come in handy during a meeting or in an upcoming project.
Unfortunately, I find myself collecting these seeds-of-thought without giving them the necessary time to percolate and develop.
Embryonic ideas about LLMs, Generative AI, cool papers from arxiv.org, and other marginalia on topics in data science and machine learning.
Notions about technology and about privacy.
Thoughts on coding, notes-to-self about my homelab, and complaints about how hard `nix` is.
And metacognition about what the heck I'm doing (or going to do) with all of it.

So I hope writing posts will be a productive way for me to develop and organize these and give them room to grow.
Some posts may be explorations of arxiv.org papers that have caught my attention.
Some posts may be blogumentation[^1], position pieces[^2] that I write to help formalize my thoughts around a particular subject, or maybe just a summary with a bunch of references I hope I'll find useful in the future.

If you happen to find a post useful, I'd appreciate _your_ thoughts... if/when I get around to adding comments.
