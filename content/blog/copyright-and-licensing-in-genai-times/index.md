      - on cameras:
        > there was a time when there was a question of whether or not if you took a picture with a camera -- right, you just click the button...
        > people argued at one point - "hey, you click that button, its machine generated, you can't have a copyright for that"
        - this is a false equivalence -- cameras weren't trained on copyrighted material and using the amount of effort to craft a prompt is irrelevant in this example

  - the solution?
    - keep track of how weights change during training; look at neurons that are activated/updated by training examples.
      then, on inference, keep track of activations and attribute credit to artists based on activations
    - TODO - are there papers that look at 'training data attribution'?
