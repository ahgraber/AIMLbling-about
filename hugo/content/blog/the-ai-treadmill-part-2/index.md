I [previously posted]({{< ref "/blog/the-ai-treadmill-2024" >}}) an introduction to the _AI Treadmill_ (so named because trying to keep up with everything felt like running on a treadmill cranked all the way up) and provided a data dump of the list of links I shared over the course of 2024.

Earlier this month, I made those (and all Treadmill updates since) available on this site.
Look for the [AI Treadmill](https://aimlbling-about.ninerealmlabs.com/treadmill) on the homepage or in the top right corner.
Bonus: the site search also works on Treadmill updates!

What started as a list of links for reference became a way for me to keep myself and my team up to date.
I refined my process for collection over the course of 2024, but focused primarily on curation rather than explanation; Treadmill sessions were primarily simple lists of links.
I've improved on this in 2025 and am attempting to provide summary and/or commentary.
