I \[previously posted\]({{< ref "/blog/the-ai-treadmill-2024" >}}) an introduction to the _AI Treadmill_ (so named because trying to keep up with everything felt like running on a treadmill cranked all the way up) and provided a data dump of the list of links I shared over the course of 2024.

Today, I've made those (and all Treadmill updates since) available on this site. Look for the [AI Treadmill](https://aimlbling-about.ninerealmlabs.com/treadmill) on the homepage or in the top right corner. Bonus: the site search also works on Treadmill content!

What started as a list of links for reference became a way for me to keep myself and my team up to date. I refined my process for collection over the course of 2024, but focused primarily on curation rather than explanation; Treadmill sessions are primarily simple lists of links. I've improved on this in 2025 and am attempting to provide summary and/or commentary.
