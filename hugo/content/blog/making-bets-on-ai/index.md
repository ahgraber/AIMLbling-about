[How Does Claude 4 Think? — Sholto Douglas & Trenton Bricken](https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/sholto-trenton-2) @ ~2hr

Sholto Douglas: _"There is this whole spectrum of crazy futures. But the one that I feel we're almost guaranteed to get—this is a strong statement to make—is one where at the very least, you get a drop-in white collar worker at some point in the next five years. I think it's very likely in two, but it seems almost overdetermined in five. On the grand scheme of things, those are kind of irrelevant timeframes. It's the same either way."_

> Note:
> There's a timeline to all of this. It's not an immediate "AI will take my job" but rather "AI will become a delegate as I manage it to do my job", and also "AI will take entry-level jobs".
> That said, being in the Trades is probably a "safer" job than most white-collar work over the medium time horizon (until we get sufficiently dextrous robots and batteries with sufficient density to power them all day)

## If you accept this premise (AI will be drop-in white-collar worker in _x_ years), what does it mean?

Compute
Energy

## If you accept this premise (AI will be drop-in white-collar worker in _x_ years), what should you do _today_?

### Individuals

Invest in ai, semiconductor, energy
Short term bet on trades

### Companies

Build ai capability and expertise. Contingencies for if ai can replace white collar work (or if you try and everything goes wrong g)

### Nations

Secure manufacturing (semiconductor, energy)
Construct power
Secure compute
Universal basic income
