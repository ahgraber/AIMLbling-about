I've recently been enamored with the concept of "fractal complexity", not pertaining to the mathematical definition of "complexity", but rather as a way to explain why "it depends" is such a frequent response in conversations between people with various levels of expertise. I believe I came across this idea while listening to an episode of ["Brad and Will Made a TechPod"](https://techpod.content.town) but I cannot find the specific reference.

## Fractals

Per [the Fractal Foundation](https://fractalfoundation.org/resources/what-are-fractals/):

> A fractal is a never-ending pattern. Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop.

## Why Fractal Complexity

The concept of "fractal complexity" presents fractals as a metaphor for branching knowledge trees and depth of expertise. In this sense, expertise/knowledge could be represented as a hierarchical tree, where each node in the tree represents the current state of knowledge. As we gain expertise on a particular topic ("zoom in" on a given node), we become aware of more detail about various related knowledge, and gain a feel for what we do and do not understand. We make connections between our current node and its related nodes, and may see the untrod paths to nodes that we have not yet fully grasped.

This is a simplistic metaphor; knowledge and expertise are not discrete steps on an objective, predefined graph. But I do think it is a powerful way to understand why "it depends" is such a frequent response when attempting to align understanding between individuals at different "depths" of the tree.

## Fractal Complexity and PhD Research

Suppose we represent all human knowledge as a fractal tree. As we step toward the outer reaches, we continually narrow the scope from "trunk" to "branch" to "twig". Human knowledge is finite, and so at some point we will reach the end of how far humanity has progressed down our metaphorical tree of knowledge - a limit node. PhD research is often done at these limit nodes. Considering the specificity of the path to arrive at the limit node, we can see why getting a PhD means you "know more and more about less and less until you know everything about nothing."

## Comprehending Fractal Complexity

Given this idea of fractal complexity as represented by navigating a knowledge tree, we could say that an individual's "comprehension of fractal complexity" is how accurately they understand their knowns and known-unknowns and can estimate the magnitude of their unknown-unknowns.

It seems to me that miscalibration of an individual's _meta-comprehension_ of their local fractal complexity might present as one of several cognitive biases. When I say "miscalibration of meta-comprehension", what I mean is that the mismatch between the theoretical _objective_ complexity, the _perceived_ complexity (e.g., the individual's comprehension of the fractal complexity), and their expectation for the _population's comprehension_ of the complexity at the same local node.

> I'm not saying that miscalibration is the **cause** of cognitive bias; I'm merely playing with the concept of fractal complexity as an analytical lens.

Let's say an individual perceives their local node to have 4 branches when it objectively has 7, but they are unaware of the existence of the 3 they are missing, then they would have erroneously high confidence in their comprehension of the local node. This could present as the Dunning-Kruger effect, a cognitive bias where an individual with objectively low capability (with respect to the population) overestimates their ability.

> [!NOTE]
> The idea of objective complexity as represented by a well-defined, discrete branching knowledge tree is **entirely** hypothetical; there is no definitive way to objectively measure discrete "ground truth" branches.

Alternatively, if an individual perceives their local node to have 4 branches when it objectively has 7, but they believe the "average" person is only aware of 3 branches, then they would erroneously believe they were better than average. This might present as the "Lake Wobegon effect", a cognitive bias where an individual perceives themselves above average.

Conversely, if the individual perceives their local node to have 7 branches when it objectively has 8, but they believe the "average" person is aware of all 8 branches, then they would erroneously believe they were worse than average. This could present as impostor syndrome, a cognitive bias where an individual with objectively high capability (with respect to the population) underestimates their competence (or overstates the population's competence).

The central node is marked in yellow while the rest of the tree fades into gray."

## It Depends

I had fun exploring this thought experiment on fractal complexity. I think it's a useful lens for discussing branching possibility spaces, and a convenient term (for those who grok it) to explain why "it depends".
